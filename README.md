# Modeling-GUI: A PyQt5-Based GUI for Statistical and Machine Learning Models

**Modeling-GUI** is a Python-based graphical user interface (GUI) that allows users to apply and visualize a variety of statistical and machine learning models without needing to write code. The package integrates models such as Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, KMeans Clustering, Gaussian fitting, and more.

This tool is built using **PyQt5** for the GUI and **matplotlib**, **seaborn**, and other scientific libraries for visualizations. Itâ€™s designed for data scientists, analysts, and machine learning enthusiasts who want to quickly prototype models and see immediate results.

## Usage

**Modeling-GUI** provides an interactive way to load data, select models, and visualize the results. Here's how to use the application:

### Supported Models

You can choose from a wide array of models, each with specific use cases:

- **OLS (Ordinary Least Squares)**: Standard linear regression model.
- **WLS (Weighted Least Squares)**: Linear regression with weighted observations.
- **GLS (Generalized Least Squares)**: A flexible linear model that accounts for heteroscedasticity.
- **Recursive LS (Recursive Least Squares)**: Online linear regression useful for time series data.
- **Rolling LS (Rolling Least Squares)**: Perform a rolling regression with a moving window.
- **RLM (Robust Linear Model)**: Linear regression that is less sensitive to outliers.
- **Random Forest**: Both classification and regression using an ensemble of decision trees.
- **Gradient Boosting**: Powerful technique for both classification and regression, focusing on reducing prediction errors.
- **KMeans Clustering**: Clustering algorithm for unsupervised learning, with customizable cluster numbers.
- **Gaussian Fitting**: Fits a Gaussian (normal distribution) curve to the data.
- **Exponential Growth/Decay Fitting**: Models exponential growth or decay patterns.

### Example Workflow

1. **Loading Data**:
   - Click the **"Load CSV"** button to load a dataset in CSV format. The dataset should contain both feature columns (X) and a target column (Y).

2. **Selecting Features**:
   - After loading the CSV, select the appropriate feature (X) and target (Y) columns from the dropdown menus.

3. **Choosing a Model**:
   - From the **"Model"** dropdown, select the model you want to run (e.g., OLS, Random Forest, KMeans Clustering).

4. **Running the Model**:
   - Click **"Run Model"** to execute the selected model and visualize the results. For customizable models (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, KMeans), a dialog box will appear allowing you to set parameters like `n_estimators` or `max_depth`.

5. **Viewing Results**:
   - The results of the model will be displayed in the output box, and visualizations (e.g., regression lines, confusion matrices, fitted curves) will be shown in separate windows.

### Model Customization

For some models, you can customize parameters via dialog boxes. For example:

- **Random Forest**: Customize the number of trees (`n_estimators`) and tree depth (`max_depth`).
- **Gradient Boosting**: Customize the number of boosting rounds (`n_estimators`) and learning rate.
- **KMeans Clustering**: Customize the number of clusters (`n_clusters`).

### Visualizations

**Modeling-GUI** includes a range of high-quality visualizations to help you understand your models:

- **Regression Models**: Scatter plots with regression lines (e.g., for OLS, WLS, GLS, RLM).
- **Classification Models**: Confusion matrices (e.g., for Random Forest classification).
- **Decision Trees**: Visual representations of decision trees in Random Forest models.
- **Gaussian Fitting**: Gaussian (normal distribution) curve fitting plots.
- **Exponential Growth/Decay Fitting**: Plots of exponential growth or decay functions.

## Dependencies

The following libraries are required to run **Modeling-GUI**:

- **pandas**: For data manipulation and loading CSV files.
- **matplotlib**: For creating visualizations.
- **seaborn**: For enhanced visualizations (e.g., heatmaps for confusion matrices).
- **statsmodels**: For statistical models like OLS, WLS, GLS, RLM.
- **scikit-learn**: For machine learning models like Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and KMeans Clustering.
- **pyqt5**: For the graphical user interface.
- **scipy**: For fitting Gaussian and exponential curves.

You can install all these dependencies using the `requirements.txt` file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
